WEBSITE PLAN (v1) - Enterprise AI + CRM + Web Builds

Purpose
- Build a best-in-class enterprise SaaS marketing site that prioritizes qualified demo and consultation requests.
- Emphasize custom websites as the primary offer, with the broader platform (AI agents, AI agent departments, CRM, automations, analytics and editor) as the system that powers long term growth.
Comment: The positioning calls out many products at once; the hero must still say one clear promise and show one primary visual (site build + portal) to avoid cognitive overload. //by web designer
Comment: Decide the single conversion goal for each page now. If websites are the flagship, the hero should be “website-first” and the platform should support that narrative instead of competing with it. //by conversion optimization specialist
Comment: I would want to know within 5 seconds if you build the site and run it, or if I need internal devs; call this out early. //by client
Comment: Add one sentence that defines qualification (who you work with) so sales does not waste calls. //by sales
Comment (agree): We should state the scope clearly: strategy, build, and ongoing optimization are included, with optional handoff to internal teams. This directly supports conversion and reduces friction. //by marketing director
Comment (agree): Keep the hero promise singular and “website-first,” then use the platform to reinforce credibility and longevity. //by marketing director

Primary Conversion
- Primary CTA: Request a Website Strategy Call or Book a Demo (single primary action per page).
- Secondary CTA: View Case Study or See Examples or Watch 90-sec Overview.
- Tertiary CTA: Talk to Sales or Contact.
Comment: “Request a Website Strategy Call” vs “Book a Demo” are two different intents; pick one default and make the other page-specific. //by conversion optimization specialist
Comment: Consider CTA wording that matches the page goal and the user’s stage (e.g., “Get Website Roadmap” on /websites). //by sales
Comment (agree): Default CTA for top-of-funnel should be “Get a Website Strategy Call,” and we can reserve “Book a Demo” for platform-heavy pages. //by marketing director
Comment (disagree): We should keep only one secondary CTA globally; multiple secondary CTAs can dilute focus. I recommend “View Case Study.” //by marketing director

Audience (ICP)
- Enterprise and mid-market operators: Marketing leaders, RevOps, and IT and security stakeholders.
- High-intent buyers searching for: enterprise web builds, AI automation for marketing and operations, CRM consolidation.
Comment: Add one or two industries or common buyer pain points to tighten the visual examples and language. //by web designer
Comment: Create role-based entry points from the hero or nav (Marketing, RevOps, IT) so each persona sees themselves quickly. //by client
Comment (agree): We should set a clear “not for” boundary (e.g., very small teams or DIY) to increase perceived focus and quality. //by marketing director

Research-Informed UX Principles (summarized)
- Users scan, not read: structure content for fast scanning with strong headings, short blocks, and clear hierarchy.
- Reduce form friction: shorter, clearer forms convert better than long forms; only ask for what you need at first.
- Place proof near decision points: trust signals should sit adjacent to CTAs.
Comment: Add a “what happens next” statement next to each CTA to reduce anxiety and increase form starts. //by conversion optimization specialist
Comment (agree): Also include “time-to-value” language near CTAs to make the next step feel worthwhile. //by marketing director

Site Map (Phase 1)
- / (Home)
- /websites (Primary conversion page)
- /agents (AI Agents)
- /departments (AI Agent Departments)
- /crm
- /automations
- /platform (Portal overview: CRM + Agents + Departments + Website analytics/editor)
- /case-studies
- /contact (Book demo or contact)
- /security (Enterprise trust)
- /about (Company and leadership credibility)
Comment: The nav mentions “Solutions” and “Resources” but these are not in the map; decide if these are real pages or remove from nav. //by web designer
Comment: Too many top-level pages can dilute focus; consider consolidating /agents and /departments into a single “AI Workforce” page until content is mature. //by conversion optimization specialist
Comment: I would want a “Pricing or Packages” cue even if it is “Contact for enterprise pricing.” //by client
Comment: Ensure /security is linked from CTA modals and footer; it is a common blocker in enterprise sales cycles. //by sales
Comment (agree): Add a lightweight “Pricing Approach” section on /websites (not a full pricing page) to address cost expectations without committing to fixed tiers. //by marketing director

Global Structure
- Persistent top nav with primary CTA button and minimal links: Platform, Websites, Solutions, Case Studies, Resources, Contact.
- Sticky CTA on mobile.
- Footer with trust badges, security, legal, and contact.
Comment: Keep the nav to 4 to 5 links max; too many items lowers click-through to the primary CTA. //by conversion optimization specialist
Comment: The footer should include an address or HQ region for legitimacy and procurement confidence. //by sales
Comment (agree): Reduce nav to “Websites, Platform, Case Studies, Security, Contact” and move the rest into the footer. //by marketing director

Narrative Arc (Home Page)
1) Hero: outcome-focused headline, clear who it is for, primary CTA, secondary CTA.
2) Trust strip: logos plus 1 to 2 quantified outcomes.
3) The core problem: enterprise teams are patching tools and agencies; results are inconsistent.
4) The solution: one platform plus elite web builds that compound growth.
5) Product pillars: Websites, AI Agents, AI Departments, CRM, Automations, Analytics and Editor.
6) How it works in 3 steps: Discover -> Build -> Run.
7) Results proof: short case study cards with metrics.
8) Security and governance: approvals, audit trails, data controls.
9) CTA band: repeat primary CTA with short benefit statement.
Comment: The hero should include one concrete outcome number (speed, pipeline, or conversion lift) to anchor credibility immediately. //by conversion optimization specialist
Comment: Consider a short “What you get in 30 days” block to make the process feel tangible. //by client
Comment (agree): Add a “30-day deliverables” callout immediately after the hero or the process section to reduce perceived risk. //by marketing director
Comment (agree): The trust strip should include a mix of logos and one short quantitative claim, not two long claims. //by marketing director

Comment (agree): Keep this page short and scanable; sales can provide the deep packet. //by marketing director

Design Direction (for implementation later)
- Typography: strong editorial headline face plus clean body type (enterprise-grade).
- Color: confident neutrals with one bold accent; avoid overly playful palettes.
- Layout: wide grids, large whitespace, strong section separators, consistent CTA placement.
- Motion: subtle reveal and scroll cues; avoid distracting animations.
Comment: Use a consistent visual motif across pages (gridlines, data panels, or blueprint aesthetic) to reinforce enterprise feel. //by web designer
Comment (agree): The motif should support the “precision and control” narrative, not look like generic AI gradients. //by marketing director

Copy Guidance
- No jargon. Use outcomes and specifics.
- Each section should answer: What is it? Who is it for? Why should I trust you?
- Use fewer, stronger claims backed by metrics or proof.
Comment: Add a “proof policy” line in content planning so claims always have a source (case study, benchmark, or internal data). //by conversion optimization specialist
Comment (agree): Avoid buzzwords like “full funnel engine” in copy; show the outcomes instead. //by marketing director

Conversion System
- Primary CTA repeated 3 to 4 times per long page (hero, mid, near proof, footer).
- Forms: 3 to 5 fields for first step; optional enrichment later.
- Add trust adjacent to CTAs: logos, case study, or security badge.
Comment: Add a low-friction exit path (e.g., “Email me a one-pager”) for visitors not ready to book. //by conversion optimization specialist
Comment (disagree): Keep the exit path subtle; it should not compete with the primary CTA on high-intent pages. //by marketing director

Implementation Notes for Codex
- Build pages one at a time, validate with npm run build after each.
- Start with Home -> Websites -> Platform -> Contact.
- Maintain consistent section components for speed.
Comment: Prioritize visual consistency and spacing tokens early so later pages feel cohesive. //by web designer
Comment (agree): Start with Home and /websites in the same sprint so messaging stays consistent. //by marketing director
