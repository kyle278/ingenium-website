## Persona Review: Marketing Director
### Colors and Typography
- Colors communicate trust and enterprise maturity; this is a strong fit for enterprise buyers.
- Typography is clean and premium, but section hierarchy is sometimes visually flat because card patterns repeat.

### Story and Cohesion
- Story is coherent: website -> system -> pipeline impact.
- Cohesion weakens because multiple pages restate the same promise with little net-new evidence.

### Positives
- Strong strategic framing around conversion and attribution.
- Security and governance are integrated into the narrative, not bolted on.
- Case studies section gives directional proof quickly.

### Negatives
- Message repetition creates fatigue; little differentiation between Platform, CRM, Automations, and Agents pages.
- Social proof is broad but not specific (few named logos, limited hard business context per result).
- Missing mid-funnel conversion offers (calculator, benchmark, downloadable frameworks).

### Flow Between Pages and Sections
- Top-nav flow is logical.
- Section flow on each page is predictable but too uniform, reducing persuasion momentum.
- Contact page asks for high intent too early without lower-friction step.

### Page-by-page, section-by-section conversion audit
- Home: Hero strong and outcome-led; Metrics strip useful but unverifiable; Industry trust strip lacks named proof; Problem clear; Conversion engine clear; Process good; Proof decent but still generic; Governance strong; Final CTA clear.
- Websites: Hero clear; Conversion engine strong; Comparison/system framing useful; Capability pillars good but abstract; Implementation path credible; First 30 days helps confidence; Proof should include named outcomes; FAQ useful; Final CTA repetitive.
- Platform: Hero clear; Modules understandable; Role-based views relevant; Integrations section too generic; Final CTA fine.

- CRM: Hero clear; CRM foundation good; Migration section strong for risk reduction; Final CTA adequate.
- Automations: Hero and workflow preview good; Workflow capabilities clear; Governance strong; Conversion tie-back good; Final CTA repetitive.
- Case studies: Hero solid; Filters helpful; Case cards too short and same shape; Final CTA should offer full PDF or metrics deep dive.
- Security: Hero strong; Controls and governance strong; Final CTA good for enterprise path.
- About: Hero and credibility useful; How we work strong; Global reach fine; Final CTA duplicates other pages.
- Contact: Hero good; Expectations reduce anxiety; Form friction is high for first touch; Contact details good; Final CTA useful.

## Persona Review: Marketing Executive
### Colors and Typography
- Professional and easy to scan.

### Page-by-page, section-by-section conversion audit
- Home: Hero compelling; Metrics attractive; trust strip light on evidence; problem section resonates; engine/process useful; proof needs deeper campaign-level detail; governance okay; CTA too top-funnel-to-bottom-funnel jump.
- Websites: Sections are relevant but need examples of actual landing page architecture, messaging matrix, and experimentation loops.

- Contact: too many inputs upfront; split into short qualification + detailed follow-up form.

---

## Cross-Persona Synthesis (Web Designer Lens)
### What must stay
- Enterprise visual direction: emerald/slate palette, clean spacing, premium typography.
- Core narrative spine: website is the growth surface; platform drives compounding conversion.
- Security and governance presence throughout the site.
- Strong top navigation structure and clear page-level intent.

### What must change
- Reduce template sameness and give each page a distinct visual and narrative role.
- Increase proof depth: named logos, richer case artifacts, measurable baseline->result context.
- Expand CTA ladder beyond "Book a Strategy Call" with progressive conversion assets.
- Improve contact conversion UX with lower-friction first step.
- Fix SEO metadata uniqueness per page (title, description, OG tags, canonical).
- Add technical confidence assets for CTO/procurement paths.

### Core story the website is trying to tell
- Current story: "Ingenium builds and operates an enterprise conversion system across website, CRM, AI agents, and automations with governance built in."
- Story strengths: clear business framing, credible enterprise tone, consistent strategic messaging.
- Story gaps: insufficient evidence density and role-specific specificity; heavy repetition blunts persuasion.

## Actionable Prompt for the Build Agent (Copy/Paste)
Use this in the website repo as the implementation brief:

```text
You are improving an existing enterprise marketing site for conversion performance. Do not redesign from scratch; preserve brand direction while increasing conversion effectiveness.

Primary objective:
Increase qualified contact conversions and proof credibility while preserving enterprise trust and narrative cohesion.

Non-negotiables to preserve:
1) Keep the existing emerald/slate premium aesthetic direction. though you can make changes so we are not so visually repitive/flat.
2) Keep Sora + Manrope style pairing (or current equivalent display/body hierarchy).
3) Keep the core narrative: website -> CRM -> AI agents -> automations -> measurable pipeline outcomes. FOCUSING ON WEBSITE BUILDS AS THIS IS OUR MAIN HOOK.
4) Keep security/governance integrated throughout, not isolated to one page.

Global fixes required:
1) Differentiate page templates visually so pages do not feel duplicated.
2) Add progressive CTA ladder:
   - Primary: Book strategy call
   - Secondary: Download framework/checklist
   - Tertiary: Request full case study/security packet
3) Add richer proof system:
   - Named logos or anonymized but specific company descriptors
   - Before/after metrics with timeframe and intervention summary
   - Visual proof artifacts (dashboard snippets, workflow snapshots)
4) Reduce contact friction:
   - Step 1 short form (name, email, biggest goal)
   - Step 2 extended qualification after initial submit or follow-up
5) Fix SEO/page metadata per page:
   - Unique title, meta description, OG title/description, canonical

   - Marketing leadership
   - Sales leadership
   - CTO/security stakeholders

## IMPORTANT — SEO Keyword Research and Optimization Addendum (US Market, 2026-02-18)
Use this section as the SEO implementation brief for the rebuild.

### 1) Research Inputs and Method
- Website audited: `https://ingenium-website-sigma.vercel.app/`.
- SERP language mining: enterprise web design, B2B web design, CRO agency, RevOps consulting, CRM implementation, marketing automation, lead routing, AI agents.
- Suggest data used: Google Suggest + Bing autosuggest (query completion patterns).
- Competitive SERP pattern review: agency/service pages and list pages currently ranking for target intent.
- Technical guidance basis: Google Search Central and web.dev documentation.

Notes:
- This is intent-driven keyword research (cluster + mapping), not final search-volume forecasting.
- Before publishing final copy, validate monthly volume and keyword difficulty in Semrush/Ahrefs for the exact target geography.

### 2) Priority Keyword Clusters (Commercial Intent First)
| Priority | Cluster | Primary Terms | Secondary/Long-tail Terms | Intent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Enterprise Website Services | `enterprise web design agency`, `enterprise website design`, `corporate web design agency` | `enterprise website redesign`, `enterprise web design services`, `enterprise website development company` | BOFU |
| P1 | B2B Website Conversion | `b2b web design agency`, `b2b website design company` | `b2b saas web design agency`, `website conversion optimization services`, `conversion-focused web design` | BOFU/MOFU |
| P1 | CRO and Revenue Growth | `conversion rate optimization agency`, `conversion rate optimization services` | `conversion optimization consulting`, `cro agency for b2b`, `conversion rate optimization pricing` | BOFU |
| P1 | RevOps + CRM Services | `revops consulting`, `revops consulting services`, `crm implementation services` | `crm implementation consulting`, `crm migration services`, `revenue operations consulting` | BOFU |
| P2 | Automation Services | `marketing automation consulting`, `marketing automation consulting services` | `marketing automation implementation services`, `lead routing automation`, `lead routing automation software` | MOFU/BOFU |
| P2 | AI Ops Services | `ai agents for marketing`, `ai agents for sales`, `sales and marketing ai agents` | `ai agents for marketing automation`, `enterprise ai agent workflows`, `ai governance workflows` | MOFU |
| P2 | Integration Intent | `website crm integration` | `crm website integration services`, `website to crm lead routing`, `crm automation integration` | MOFU/BOFU |
| P3 | Decision Support | `website redesign cost`, `average cost of website redesign` | `enterprise website redesign cost`, `b2b website redesign examples`, `revops consulting firms` | MOFU |

### 3) Page-by-Page Keyword Target Map
Each page should have exactly one primary keyword target and 3-6 secondary support terms.

| URL | Primary Keyword | Secondary Keywords |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | `enterprise web design agency` | `enterprise website systems`, `conversion-focused web design`, `website crm ai integration` |
| `/websites` | `enterprise website redesign` | `enterprise web design services`, `b2b website redesign`, `website conversion optimization services` |
| `/platform` | `website crm ai platform` | `revenue operations platform`, `website crm integration`, `pipeline attribution` |
| `/agents` | `ai agents for marketing and sales` | `enterprise ai agents`, `ai workflow automation`, `ai governance` |
| `/departments` | `ai departments for revenue teams` | `ai team workflows`, `human approval workflows`, `ai operations governance` |
| `/crm` | `crm implementation services` | `crm implementation consulting`, `crm migration services`, `revops consulting` |
| `/automations` | `marketing automation consulting services` | `lead routing automation`, `sales automation workflows`, `pipeline automation` |
| `/case-studies` | `enterprise website case studies` | `website redesign results`, `conversion lift case study`, `b2b website examples` |
| `/security` | `enterprise website security and governance` | `ai governance`, `soc 2 readiness`, `vendor security review` |
| `/about` | `enterprise website consulting team` | `revops consulting company`, `website growth partner`, `conversion strategy consulting` |
| `/contact` | `website strategy consultation` | `book website strategy call`, `conversion strategy call`, `request security packet` |

### 4) Metadata Optimization (Immediate Fix)
Current issue found in audit: titles and meta descriptions are effectively duplicated across core pages.

Implement:
- Unique `<title>` for every core URL (50-60 chars target).
- Unique meta description for every core URL (140-160 chars target).
- Canonical tag on every indexable page.
- Unique OG title/description per page for social shares.

Suggested title patterns:
- Home: `Enterprise Web Design Agency | Ingenium`
- Websites: `Enterprise Website Redesign Services | Ingenium`
- Platform: `Website + CRM + AI Platform for Revenue Teams | Ingenium`
- CRM: `CRM Implementation and RevOps Services | Ingenium`
- Automations: `Marketing and Lead Routing Automation Services | Ingenium`
- Security: `Enterprise Security and AI Governance | Ingenium`

### 5) SEO Content Gaps to Add (Net-New Pages)
Add these pages to capture high-intent queries now missing from the architecture:
- `/enterprise-web-design-agency` (money page, highly commercial).
- `/b2b-website-redesign-cost` (decision-stage calculator or pricing framework).
- `/conversion-rate-optimization-services` (CRO authority + offer page).
- `/revops-consulting-services` (RevOps demand capture).
- `/crm-migration-services` (migration-specific intent).
- `/lead-routing-automation` (workflow-specific intent).
- `/ai-agents-for-sales-and-marketing` (AI ops demand capture).
- `/resources/website-redesign-checklist-enterprise` (linkable MOFU asset).

### 6) On-Page Optimization Rules for Rebuild
- Put primary keyword in:
  - title tag
  - H1
  - first 120 words
  - at least one H2
  - URL slug (for net-new pages)
- Use semantic H2s that mirror intent modifiers:
  - `services`, `process`, `pricing`, `case studies`, `security`, `faq`.
- Expand FAQ sections to answer search-style questions (can support rich results where eligible).
- Strengthen evidence blocks:
  - named client type
  - baseline metric
  - intervention summary
  - outcome + timeframe
- Add alt text for all meaningful images with descriptive, non-spammy phrasing.

### 7) Internal Linking Strategy (Anchor Plan)
Use contextual anchors (not generic “learn more”) to distribute authority:
- Home -> `/websites`: `enterprise website redesign services`
- Home -> `/crm`: `crm implementation services`
- Home -> `/automations`: `lead routing automation`
- `/websites` -> `/case-studies`: `enterprise website case studies`
- `/crm` -> `/automations`: `marketing and sales automation workflows`
- `/security` -> `/contact`: `request security review`
- Case studies -> money pages with anchors tied to service terms.

### 8) Technical SEO Checklist (Must Ship)
- XML sitemap includes all indexable pages and is submitted in Search Console.
- `robots.txt` present and not blocking core pages.
- Canonical tags valid and self-referencing unless intentionally canonicalized elsewhere.
- Structured data:
  - `Organization` + `WebSite` on home.
  - `BreadcrumbList` sitewide.
  - `Service` schema on service pages.
  - `FAQPage` only where FAQ content is fully visible on page.
- Core Web Vitals targets at p75:
  - LCP <= 2.5s
  - INP <= 200ms
  - CLS <= 0.1
- Ensure mobile rendering parity for all key content and metadata.

### 9) 90-Day SEO Execution Sequence
