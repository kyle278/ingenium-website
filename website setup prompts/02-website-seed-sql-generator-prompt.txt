You are working inside the Ingenium website project. Generate a single idempotent SQL seed script for Supabase that inserts/updates ALL website content blocks and active website forms needed by the current site.

Requirements:
1) Target tables:
- public.website_content_blocks
- public.website_forms

2) Source of truth:
- Read the current website pages/components and extract all visible copy that should be editable in Portal.
- Include navigation/footer copy and page-level sections (home, about, websites, platform, agents, departments, automations, crm, case-studies, security, contact).

3) Content block model:
- Populate these columns for every block:
  account_id, site_id, block_key, label, block_type, content, content_json,
  section (legacy), page_key, section_key, page_label, section_label,
  max_length, helper_text, is_editable, sort_order, is_published
- Use explicit page_key + section_key for all new rows.
- Keep section legacy column populated for compatibility.
- block_key must be stable and deterministic.
- Use block_type = 'text' for scalar strings, and 'custom' for arrays/objects stored in content_json.
- Mark all editable rows is_editable = true and is_published = true.

4) Upsert behavior:
- Use ON CONFLICT to make reruns safe.
- Conflict key for content blocks: (site_id, block_key)
- Conflict key for forms: (site_id, slug)
- Update mutable fields + updated_at on conflict.

5) Forms:
- Insert/update at least the contact form in website_forms.
- Ensure fields JSON contains standard keys where possible:
  email, first_name, last_name, phone, company, title, plus extra fields as needed.
- is_active must be true.

6) IDs and parameters:
- Put account_id and site_id in a WITH params CTE at top of script.
- Do not hardcode those IDs in multiple places.
- Keep the script wrapped in begin/commit.

7) Output format:
- Return ONLY SQL in one code block.
- Include short SQL comments for each section (content blocks, forms, verification queries).
- Include verification SELECT statements at the end to confirm rows exist.

Before generating SQL, first print a compact mapping table (as SQL comments) of:
- page_key
- section_key
- block_key
- block_type
Then generate the executable SQL.
