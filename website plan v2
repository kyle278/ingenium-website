WEBSITE PLAN V2 — Ingenium Digital Consulting
Created: February 13, 2026
Purpose: Enterprise-grade SaaS website that prioritizes website builds as the core offer, backed by AI agents, CRM, automations, and governance. Primary KPI: qualified form conversions.

Global Direction
- Positioning: “Enterprise website systems that drive pipeline, with the AI operations behind them.”
- Primary conversion: Book a Strategy Call (form + calendar).
- Secondary conversion: View Case Studies, Download Security Packet (gated).
- Proof-first: Every major page includes at least one proof block (metric, industry badge, or result).
- Visual language: calm enterprise palette, high contrast typography, clean spacing, soft depth (shadows), subtle gradients, iconography for all feature lists.

Design System
- Layout: Max width 1200px, consistent section padding (desktop 96px top/bot, mobile 64px).
- Grid: 12-column on desktop, 4-column on mobile.
- Buttons: Primary (solid), Secondary (outline), Tertiary (text). Single primary color across site.
- Cards: 2 types
  - Card Solid: white background, soft shadow, rounded corners.
  - Card Soft: light tint background, no shadow, rounded corners.
- Badges: small uppercase labels for context.
- Icon set: use a consistent icon style (line or solid) for all lists.
- Trust: logo strip or industry list on high-intent pages.

Narrative Flow
1) Establish enterprise website systems as the product.
2) Prove it with outcomes and case studies.
3) Explain the platform behind the site (agents, CRM, automations).
4) Show governance and security.
5) Convert with clear CTA.
